## Overview

This repository contains the MATLAB code used to generate the results in the paper:

“Adiabatic-section flow in axial-groove heat pipes with varying meniscus curvature.”

The repository includes:

Scripts for computing meniscus curvature variations

Numerical routines for evaluating flow resistance

Semi-analytical asymptotic components

(Optional) plotting scripts used to reproduce figures from the paper

Reproducing the Paper’s Results

To reproduce the figures or compute the capillary limit:

Set the geometric and thermophysical parameters in the main script.

Run the solver to compute local meniscus curvature and flow fields.

Post-process results using the included plotting and analysis scripts.

All functions are modularized to allow users to adapt the solver to different AGHP geometries or material systems.
